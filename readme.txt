Keep a snippet library of text or HTML to be used in posts. Variables
can be set for more flexibility. Inserts directly or as shortcodes.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you build a library with snippets of HTML or reoccurring
plain text that you often use in your posts and pages. You can use
predefined variables to replace parts of the snippet on insert. All snippets are
available in the post editor via a button in the Visual and HTML modes. The 
snippet can be inserted as defined, or as a shortcode to keep flexibility for
updating the snippet. PHP code is supported for snippets inserted as shortcodes.
